Working with branches:
- Make sure you are on the main branch (Terminal: git checkout main)
- Then create a new branch for you to work on (Terminal: git checkout -b yourBranchName)
- Make all your changes on that branch
- Go back on the main branch (Terminal: git checkout main)
- Merge your branch into the main branch (Terminal: git merge yourBranchName)
